## How quotes work
Send:
1) Photos (wide shot + close-up)  
2) Measurements (where relevant)  
3) Your address/neighborhood (for travel)  
4) Any product links you already bought

I’ll reply with either a fixed price or a range + what would change it.

## Materials
Basic consumables (anchors, screws, patch compound, etc.) can be billed at cost or included — pick one and keep it consistent.
