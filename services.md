## How It Works

1. Send photos + a short task list
2. I confirm it's a good fit and recommend the right package
3. Book your Thursday or Sunday slot with a $20 deposit — applied to your total. If I can't take the job for any reason, you're fully refunded.
4. I show up, get it done, clean up, and collect the remainder at the end

## Not Included

No emergencies. No major electrical, plumbing, or HVAC. No structural work. No large drywall jobs. No big remodels. Ladder work beyond a basic step stool — ask first if unsure.
