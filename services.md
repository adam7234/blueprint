# Services

Blueprint Home Services handles small-to-medium home repairs, maintenance, and light improvements. The goal is simple: fix the problem, do it cleanly, and leave you with a result that holds up.

If you’re not sure whether your job fits, send a quick description + photos and I’ll tell you honestly.

## Repairs and fixes

Common jobs:

- Adjusting or repairing doors (sticking, misaligned strike plates, loose hinges)
- Replacing hardware (handles, knobs, latches, locks you provide or I can source)
- Minor carpentry repairs (trim, baseboards, small wood repairs)
- Patch-and-repair for small damage areas

## Drywall and paint touch-ups

- Small drywall patches (holes, dents, nail pops)
- Repair prep for painting (sanding, spackle, clean edges)
- Paint touch-ups (best when you have matching paint)

Note: Full-room painting can be done case-by-case, but most work is small-area repair and touch-up.

## Sealing, caulking, and weatherproofing

- Re-caulking tubs, showers, sinks, and backsplashes
- Sealing gaps around trim, baseboards, and penetrations
- Simple drafts and leak prevention (weatherstripping, door sweeps)

These jobs are underrated — they prevent bigger problems.

## Mounting and installation

- Shelves, mirrors, curtain rods, blinds
- TV mounting (stud mounting only; surface type matters)
- Towel bars, hooks, bathroom accessories
- Light assembly (furniture, small fixtures, wall-mounted items)

If you have product links ahead of time, send them — it helps confirm fit and time.

## Light plumbing swaps (non-permitted)

Typical swaps:

- Faucets, showerheads, handheld sprayers
- Toilet seats, basic flappers/fill valves (simple repairs)
- Accessible shutoff valves when straightforward

If there’s corrosion, hidden leaks, or supply lines that look sketchy, I’ll stop and recommend a plumber. No gambling with water.

## Home maintenance support

- “Punch list” help for move-in / move-out / rental turnover
- Seasonal prep checklist (spring/fall)
- Small fixes bundled into a single visit to save time and cost

## What I don’t take on

To keep quality high and avoid unsafe work, I don’t take:

- Major electrical work (panel work, new circuits, service changes)
- Gas line work
- Structural work (load-bearing framing, major rot, foundation issues)
- Roof work beyond very minor/low-risk tasks
- Mold remediation
- Jobs that require permits (unless explicitly agreed with proper professionals)

If you’re unsure, ask. I’ll tell you quickly.

## Pricing approach

Most jobs fall into one of two buckets:

- **Small fixed jobs** (simple installs/swaps)
- **Half-day / day work** for bundles and more complex tasks

I’ll give you a clear plan before starting. If something changes once we open up a wall or uncover hidden damage, I’ll stop and talk through options.
