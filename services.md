Turnovers, small repairs, and make-ready closeouts — done carefully and scheduled simply.

If you already have a list (turn list, punch list, inspection items), you’re the ideal client. Send photos + the list and I’ll confirm fit, estimate, and next availability (Thursdays + Sundays).

## Best fit

This is a good fit if you need:
- A rental turned over (make-ready list)
- An inspection repair list closed out
- A bundle of small fixes handled in one visit

Not a fit for:
- Remodels / multi-day projects
- Major plumbing or electrical work
- Anything that requires opening walls or specialized licensing

## The work I do most

### 1) Turnover / punch-list visits (best value)
Multiple small tasks in one appointment. Common items:
- Patch small holes (anchors, nail pops) and prep for paint
- Caulk touch-ups (kitchen/bath where accessible)
- Replace / adjust basic hardware (handles, knobs, hinges)
- Doors: sticking, sagging, latch alignment, strike plate tweaks
- Blinds, curtain rods, towel bars, hooks (simple installs)

### 2) Patching + touch-up prep
- Small holes, dents, anchor damage
- Patch → sand → ready for paint
- Paint touch-ups (best if matching paint is available)

### 3) Doors, locks, and hardware
- Hinge swaps, handle/knob swaps
- Deadbolt installs (existing prep preferred)
- Latch alignment and smooth closing
- Closet door adjustments and minor fixes

### 4) Sealing + weatherproofing
Small jobs that prevent expensive ones:
- Re-caulking tubs, showers, sinks (as needed)
- Weatherstripping / door sweeps
- Air-gap sealing around trim and penetrations (accessible areas)

### 5) Light plumbing swaps (simple + accessible)
- Showerheads, sprayers, faucets (straightforward swaps)
- Toilet basics (flapper / fill valve / supply line if accessible)
If anything looks corroded, actively leaking, or risky, I’ll stop and recommend a plumber. No gambling with water.

## How to request a visit

Send:
- Your neighborhood / zip code
- Your list (bullet points are fine)
- Photos (wide shot + close-up for each item)
- Access notes (tenant/owner occupied, lockbox, parking)
- Your preferred timeframe

Then use the Contact page to reach out. I’ll reply with: fit/not-a-fit, an estimate range, and the next available slot.
