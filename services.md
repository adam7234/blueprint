Have a few fixes (or a small project) in mind? Let’s get it done.

I offer two simple packages for Baltimore homeowners. Book ahead only. Thursdays + Sundays. Photos required.

## Package 1: Quick Fix Session (Up to 2 Hours)
Best for: 1–3 small tasks.

Examples:
- Hanging/mounting (shelves, curtain rods, mirrors, TV mount)
- Door + hardware adjustments (sticking doors, loose handles, strike plates)
- Caulking touch-ups (kitchen/bath)
- Small drywall patches
- Basic fixture swaps (simple, straightforward)

## Package 2: Half-Day Reset (Up to 4 Hours)
Best for: a punch list (roughly 4–8 small tasks) or a few more involved installs.

Examples:
- Multiple mounts/installs around the home
- Several doors/hardware fixes
- Multiple patches + touch-ups
- A handful of small repairs across rooms

## How It Works
1. Send photos + a short list.
2. I confirm it’s a fit and recommend the right package.
3. You book a Thu/Sun slot.
4. Work gets done and cleaned up.

## Boundaries
Small repairs and installs only. No emergencies. No major electrical/plumbing/HVAC. No structural work. No big remodels.

## Service Area
Baltimore City + nearby (about a 30-minute radius).

Ready?
Send your photos + list and I’ll confirm fit and pricing.
