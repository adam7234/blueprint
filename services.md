# Blueprint Maintenance and Handyman Services

Baltimore-based handyman help for homeowners who want small projects done cleanly and correctly.

I’m not a “call me for anything” contractor. I focus on small repairs, installs, and punch lists — the stuff that piles up and never gets finished.

## What I do best
- Mounting and installs (shelves, curtain rods, mirrors, TV mounts)
- Doors and hardware fixes (sticking doors, loose handles, hinges, strikes)
- Caulking touch-ups (kitchen/bath)
- Small drywall patches and touch-ups
- Simple, straightforward fixture swaps

If something is outside scope or needs a licensed pro, I’ll tell you early so you don’t waste time.

## Simple packages (no surprises)
I offer two straightforward options so pricing stays predictable:
- Quick Fix Session (up to 2 hours)
- Half-Day Reset (up to 4 hours)

The goal is fast progress, clean results, and zero weird billing.

## How it works
1. You send photos + a short list  
2. I confirm it’s a fit and recommend the right package  
3. You book a Thursday or Sunday slot  
4. I show up prepared, knock it out, and clean up

## Boundaries (keeps things smooth)
Small repairs and installs only.
- No emergencies
- No major electrical/plumbing/HVAC
- No structural work
- No big remodels

## Service area
Baltimore City + nearby (about a 30-minute radius).

Hi, I’m Adam. I built Blueprint to be the reliable “get it done” option for homeowners — clear scope, tight scheduling, and a clean finish. Send photos first so I can show up with the right tools and hardware and we can actually make progress in one visit.
