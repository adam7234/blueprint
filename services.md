## How It Works

1. Send photos and a short task list
2. I review the job, confirm whether it is a fit, and recommend the right service block
3. If approved, I send the booking link for a Thursday or Sunday slot and collect a $10 deposit, applied to your total
4. I show up, get it done, clean up, and collect the remainder at the end
