# Services – Blueprint Maintenance

**Baltimore apartment turn & make-ready specialists.**  
We turn vacant units into rent-ready ones—fast (often same-week), clean, fully photo-documented, and with zero surprises.

Choose the package that fits your turnover needs:

### Full Turn Package – Up to 8-Hour Block
**Ideal for:** Complete post-move-out make-ready on 1–2 bedroom units. Handles the bulk of small-to-medium fixes so leasing can start ASAP.

**What’s typically included:**
- Full drywall patching, texture matching, and spot/whole-room paint touch-ups → Fresh, move-in-ready walls
- Caulking, sealing, weatherproofing, and minor water-damage prep → No leaks or drafts
- Door/hardware repairs or replacements (knobs, hinges, closers, sweeps)
- Mounting & installation (shelves, blinds, curtain rods, misc.)
- Straightforward fixture/trim swaps
- Light plumbing fixes (faucets, showerheads, valves, lines)
- Smoke/CO detector swaps (with new batteries if needed)
- Final walkthrough + detailed photo closeout of every item

**Outcome:** Unit photo-ready for listings/showings. Delivered: itemized list, notes, timestamped photos.

**Pricing:** Fixed block rate (most units fit in 8 hrs). Quote after photos/punch list review—fast and no-obligation.

### Punch List Package – Up to 4-Hour Block
**Ideal for:** Quick hits when the unit is nearly ready but needs final fixes to avoid leasing delays.

**What’s typically included:**
- Targeted drywall patches and paint touch-ups
- Caulking/sealing fixes
- Door/hardware adjustments
- Small mounting/installs
- Fixture/trim replacements
- Light plumbing swaps
- Detector swaps

### Our Simple 4-Step Process
1. Send address + punch list (or photos/video).

3. Schedule—we arrive equipped and on time.
4. Get closeout: completed items, notes, pro photos.

### Boundaries (We Keep It Honest)
