Have a few fixes (or a small project) in mind? Blueprint Maintenance helps Baltimore homeowners knock out small repairs and installs without the runaround.

This is a simple, owner-operated service focused on clean work, clear communication, and getting your punch list done efficiently.

## What I’m good for
- Hanging / mounting (shelves, curtain rods, mirrors, TV mounts)
- Door + hardware adjustments (sticking doors, loose handles, strike plates)
- Caulking touch-ups (kitchen/bath)
- Small drywall patches + minor touch-ups
- Basic fixture swaps (simple, straightforward)

## How it works
1. Send photos + a short list.
2. I confirm it’s a fit and recommend the right package (2-hour or 4-hour).
3. You book a Thu/Sun slot.
4. Work gets done and cleaned up.

## Boundaries
Small repairs and installs only. No emergencies. No major electrical/plumbing/HVAC. No structural work. No big remodels.

## Service area
Baltimore City + nearby (about a 30-minute radius).
