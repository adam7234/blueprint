Baltimore-based turn and make-ready support for landlords and property managers.

The goal is simple: get units back to rent-ready with clean execution, tight scope control, and photo documentation you can file and trust.

## Who we serve
Landlords and property managers who want a dependable partner to:
- Knock out punch lists quickly
- Handle the small-to-medium work that bottlenecks turns
- Provide clear, timestamped photos for records and liability protection

If something is out of scope or needs a licensed specialist, we flag it early so you can route it correctly.

## What we do
Turn and make-ready services, including:
- Drywall patching and paint touch-ups
- Caulking, sealing, weatherproofing, and minor water-damage cleanup
- Door and hardware fixes (handles, strikes, hinges, closers)
- Mounting and installs (shelves, blinds, curtain rods, misc. items)
- Straightforward fixture and trim replacements
- Light plumbing swaps (faucets, showerheads, supply lines, shutoff valves)
- Smoke/CO detector device swaps (replacement only)
- Final walkthrough with photo closeout documentation

## How it works
1. Send details  
   Address + punch list, or a quick photo/video walkthrough.

2. Scope and quote  
   Fast confirmation of what’s in/out of scope, plus block pricing (half-day/full-day) or a simple estimate.

3. Schedule and execute  
   On-time arrival, prepared work, and short progress updates.

4. Closeout package  
   Completed list, notes on anything discovered, and timestamped photos of each finished item.

## What you can expect
- Fast communication and clear next steps
- Tight scope control to avoid surprises and delays
- Clean finish with minimal callbacks
- Photo documentation for owners, tenants, or your internal files
- If we find a bigger issue, you hear about it immediately

## Boundaries (keeps turns predictable)
We focus on small-to-medium turn items. We do not handle:
- Major electrical work
- HVAC diagnostics or refrigerant handling
- Structural repairs
- Any task requiring specialty licensing beyond basic replacements

If a licensed trade is the better (or required) path, we’ll tell you upfront.

## Service area
- Baltimore City and immediate surrounding areas  
- Outside that radius? Reach out and we’ll tell you what’s realistic.

## About the owner

Hi, I’m Adam. I run Blueprint Maintenance Services and focus on one thing: making turns smoother for you. That means showing up prepared, keeping scope tight, communicating clearly, and documenting everything so you’re never guessing what was done and what still needs attention.

If you want, you can replace this paragraph with a more personal story, your background, your standards, and the types of properties you work best with.
