# Blueprint Maintenance Services

**Baltimore-based turn & make-ready support for landlords and property managers.**

We deliver one clear outcome:  
**Units back to rentable—fast, clean, fully documented, and surprise-free.**

No delays, no endless back-and-forth, no unexpected callbacks.

### Who We Serve
Landlords and property managers who want a dependable partner to:
- Knock out punch lists quickly
- Handle small-to-medium fixes that bottleneck turns
- Provide crystal-clear photo documentation for records and liability protection

If a job falls outside our scope or requires a licensed specialist, we tell you **immediately** so you can route it correctly.

### What We Do
Focused turn and make-ready services, including:

- Drywall patching and paint touch-ups
- Caulking, sealing, weatherproofing, and minor water-damage cleanup
- Door & hardware repairs (handles, strikes, hinges, closers)
- Mounting & installation (shelves, blinds, curtain rods, miscellaneous items)
- Straightforward fixture and trim replacements
- Accessible light plumbing swaps (faucets, showerheads, supply lines, shutoff valves)
- Smoke/CO detector replacements (device swap only)
- Final walkthrough + detailed photo closeout documentation

**Process is simple:**  
Send us your punch list—or just photos/video of the unit.  
We'll propose a clear closeout plan and pricing.

### How It Works
1. **Send us details**  
   Property address + punch list (or photos/video walkthrough).

2. **We scope & quote**  
   Fast confirmation of what's in/out of scope + block pricing (half-day/full-day) or simple estimate.

3. **We schedule & execute**  
   We arrive on time, fully prepared, and keep you updated.

4. **You receive closeout**  
   Completed items list, notes on anything extra, and timestamped photos of every finished task.

### What You Can Expect
- Lightning-fast communication and crystal-clear next steps
- Strict scope control → no risky surprises or scope creep
- Clean, professional finish with minimal callbacks
- Reliable on-time arrival and real-time progress updates
- Comprehensive photo documentation for your files, tenants, or owners

### Our Boundaries (Keeps Turns Smooth & Predictable)
We specialize in small-to-medium turn items.  
We **do not** handle:
- Major electrical work
- HVAC diagnostics or refrigerant handling
- Structural repairs
- Any task requiring specialty licensing beyond basic replacements

If a licensed trade is the better (or required) path, we'll flag it upfront—no guesswork.

### Service Area
- Baltimore City and immediate surrounding areas  
- Slightly farther out? Reach out—we'll let you know what's realistic.
