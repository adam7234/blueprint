Blueprint Home Services is a small Baltimore-based handyman and home maintenance service built around a simple idea: do the work carefully, communicate clearly, and leave your home better than we found it.

I started Blueprint because I like practical work and I care about quality. This business is “learning-by-doing” in the best sense: I take on the right jobs, do them properly, and build a track record you can trust. If a job is outside my scope, I’ll tell you upfront and help you think through the next best step.

## What we do

Blueprint focuses on small-to-medium home repairs, upkeep, and light improvements, including:

- Basic repairs and fixes (doors, hardware, minor carpentry)
- Drywall patching and paint touch-ups
- Caulking, sealing, weatherproofing
- Mounting and installation (shelves, blinds, curtain rods, TV mounts)
- Light plumbing swaps (faucets, showerheads, shutoff valves where accessible)
- Home maintenance checklists and seasonal prep

If you’re not sure whether your job fits, send a quick description and photos. I’ll tell you if it’s a match.

## How it works

1. You send the job details (what’s going on + photos if possible).
2. I reply with a plan: either a simple estimate or a short visit to assess.
3. We schedule the work.
4. You get clear documentation: what I did, what materials were used, and what to watch for.

## What you can expect

- Clear communication and realistic timelines
- Respect for your home (cleaner in, cleaner out)
- No drama, no upsell games
- Honest boundaries on what I can and cannot take on

## Service area

Baltimore City and nearby areas. If you’re slightly outside the core area, still reach out — I’ll tell you if it’s feasible.

## Values

- Do it right or don’t do it
- Show up when you say you will
- Explain options in plain English
- Build trust over time
